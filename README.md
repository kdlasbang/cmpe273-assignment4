* python3 CH_cache_client.py and python3 RH_cache_client.py to test for consistent hashing and RHW Hashing. 
* These two Hashing files are consistanthash.py and rendezvousHash.py  

# Consistent Hashing and RHW Hashing

The distributed cache you implemented in the midterm is based on naive modula hashing to shard the data.

## Part I.

Implement Rendezvous hashing to shard the data.


## Part II.

Implement consistent hashing to shard the data.

Features:

* Add virtual node layer in the consistent hashing.
* Implement virtual node with data replication.
